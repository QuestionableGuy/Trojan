# Section 1
## Part A - Introduction

Trojan is compact, easy to use and reliable coding language that takes simplicity to another level. Helping users create cool, interesting and creative tools and programs for others to install and fiddle with.

Trojan works by creating easy to use varibles that are linked to many different functions. This allows simple commands to run complex functions resulting in a cleaner workflow, and overall increase in productivity.

Trojan is coded in Roblox's frankenstien of language (a mixture of C++ and Lua), and works as the primary language in AIDA (CLI Terminal for Roblox). A lot of the main core functions that help Trojan stay reliable and on top in regards to its combatility with Synapse and other injection softwares. With that in mind, it helps us to push the limits everyday- and we hope other can be inspired enough to check out ADIA and maybe give coding with Trojan a try!

## Part B - Variables

A lot of Trojan, and how its used, is coded from Variables. They help a lot in keeping everything very tight and secure. As well as improving the simplicity of Trojan.

Program Variables
```lua
local ProgramName = ""
```
